# Forbes Athlete Salary Level Analysis
litongwang Tableau
# Introduction to Visualization
This is a Forbes list of all types of athletes that visualizes the salary data of all athletes. We compare salaries online and offline. 

Here is a link to our raw data: https://data.world/makeovermonday/the-worlds-highest-paid-athletes-in-2023
# What we did
We have used bar charts to visualize this data and we have tried to show the athletes on-field salary and off-field salary in two bar charts respectively. Additionally, we used color to show the difference in total salaries, with the higher salary bar being darker in color and vice versa.

# Detailed Step 1
We downloaded the xlsx version of the original data from the dataset link.
# Detailed Step 2
We cleaned the dataset and we numericized the payroll fields in the dataset to ensure that the data would display properly when imported into Tableau.
# Detailed Step 3
Create a bar chart. Use two bar charts to represent the salary levels of the athletes on and off the field.
# Detailed Step 4
Use colors to visualize the total salary.
